Step 1

Create a Car class with the following properties: brand, model, color, km and year.
Add a method "kmPerYear". Calculates the km per year.
Create 3 instances and add them to an array (Bonus: read the data from a JSON file using AJAX).
Find and print the car with the highest km per year (loop over array).
Step 2 (using Bootstrap)

Show all cars in an HTML table (dynamically - using code)
Add a form with input fields for a car. Clicking on add will create an instance of this car and will add to the array and to the table.
Bonus: the car with the highest km per year will be highlighted
